# Mocha_API_newman_node.js

Project illustrates using newman for API testing using JS. 

`https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman`

Newman is a command-line collection runner for Postman. It allows you to effortlessly run and test a Postman collection directly from the command-line. It is built with extensibility in mind so that you can easily integrate it with your continuous integration servers and build systems.

Normally Newman is used to run API tests exported from Postman. But I have deep dived to debug the newman API to execute from JS instead of exported JSON from postman.
